\begin{abstract}
This paper provides an investigation of the utilization of the context environment information in wired network routing, in order to provide technical subsidies for the advancement of IoT systems on the intelligent routing. The importance of intelligent choice of routes in a wired network is discussed. Further, this paper provides an assessment of the network context, which influence the routing process. The role of distributed processing of information for inference based on the context and the broader use of the sensed data is the central theme of this paper. The presented results provide a new approach for the use of sensor network data, increasing the applicability of IoT networks.
