\begin{abstract}
This paper provides an investigation of the utilization of the context environment information approach to wireless networks routing analysis. The importance of intelligent choice of routes in wireless networks is demonstrated. Further, this paper provides an assessment of the network context, which influence the routing process. The presented results allow evaluating which environment context is most suitable to promote sensory inference that may enhance the network performance.
